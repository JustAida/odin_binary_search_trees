# Create a "Node" class that has the following attributes:
#   "data" for the data it stores
#   "left" for its left children
#   "right" for its right children

# Create a "Tree" class that accepts array when initialized.
# The attribute for "Tree" class is:
#   "root" which will return the value of #build_tree
# Create a #build_tree method which takes an array then sort it, remove duplicates
#   and turns it into a balanced binary tree. It returns level-0 root node.
# Create an #insert and #delete method.
# Create a #find method. It accepts a value and returns the node of that given value.
